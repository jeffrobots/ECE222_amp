Suggested Devices & Notes
__________________
Input Circuit:
	* Make sure to couple with a capacitor to filter out any DC component.
	*	10k input Impedance
	*	RC Filter @ 3MHz is sufficient
	*	Series resistance to current limit
		- We will want to choose a low resistor for this to limit noise

Gain Stage:
	*	Op Amp (non-inverting for noise)
		Op Amp choices can be taken from
		 http://nwavguy.blogspot.com/2011/08/op-amp-measurements.html

Volume Control:
	*	Located between gain stage and output
	*	Want to filter out DC with a cap
	*	Set gain to avoid channel imbalance (which usually occurs in lower 5% of pot level)
	*	Audio Taper (?)

Output Stage:
	*	Use an op amp or current buffer
		- Need high current
		- Low distortion
		- Through Hole
		- 12-24 Volts (for AC and DC op)
	* Suggested Parts:
		- NJM4556, TLC2062, RC4580, or NJM2068
	* Connected the two output op-amps (if we use two) can be done with a 1-2 ohm resistor
	* Can current limit the output actively
		- Or, more cheaply, we can just use resistors


Ground:
	* Star ground is best
		- Let each stage have its own path to a single ground reference
		- There might not even be a different with this in simulation

Power Management:
	* Need to do additional research on what to do for this.
