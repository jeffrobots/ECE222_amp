# Headphone Amplifier Project
# By @jeffrobots

The files in this project are associated with a headphone amplifier simulation and design for ECE222. 

The project will require the following steps:
- [ ] Research and plan overall design and specify requirements
- [ ] Construct a block diagram of headphone amplifier
- [ ] Pick optimal parts and simulate design in HSPICE
- [ ] Build hardware version of headphone amplifier
- [ ] Verify functionality

Optional goals include: 
- [ ] Don't break and headphones in the process
- [ ] Finish without an all-nighter in ITS
