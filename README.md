# ECE222_amp
# Headphone Amplifier Project
# By @jeffrobots 

The files in this project are associated with a headphone amplifier simulation and design for ECE222. 

The project will require the following steps:
- [x] Research and plan overall design and specify requirements
- [ ] Construct a block diagram of headphone amplifier
- [x] Pick optimal parts and simulate design in HSPICE
- [ ] Build hardware version of headphone amplifier
- [ ] Verify functionality

Optional goals include: 
- [ ] Don't break any headphones in the process
- [ ] Finish without an all-nighter in ITS


Tasks:
- [x] Increase gain of gain stage to provide 35mA at output (will need to multiply gain by ~2.5)
- [x] Optimize capacitor in gain stage feedback to provide 18-20kHz bandwidth
- [ ] Place a better op amp in gain stage
- [ ] Verify output impedance, input impedance, and power @ 32 ohms
- [ ] Noise Testing
- [ ] Power Management :(
